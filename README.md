## Overview

**NeuroAgent** is an experimental distributed AI architecture designed for advanced humanoid robots and embodied AI agents. Inspired by the human nervous system, it processes asynchronous, multimodal sensor data using embedding models and a Graph Database, enabling selective attention and differentiated response pathways:

- **Reflex Master** for immediate, low-latency responses (like reflexes)
- **Deliberative Master** for high-level, context-aware reasoning and feedback

This architecture aims to bridge the gap between biological intelligence and AI, facilitating safe, efficient, and adaptive real-world interaction.

## Core Concepts

- **Multimodal Sensing:** Integrate diverse sensors (vision, chemical, haptic, physical, IR, UV, etc.), each pre-processed by domain-specific embedding models.
- **GraphDB Memory:** Store all sensory embeddings as nodes and relationships, enabling semantic and temporal pattern retrieval.
- **Selective Attention:** Prioritize and filter information through cosine similarity search in the graph, akin to the brain's focus mechanism.
- **Dual-Master Nodes:**
  - **Deliberative Master:** Provides thoughtful, multi-sensory feedback and reasoning.
  - **Reflex Master:** Executes rapid, priority-based actions for the humanoid agent.

All sensors operate asynchronously.

Embeddings are indexed as graph nodes with semantic relationships.

Both master nodes operate on graph queries:

Deliberative Master handles slow, context-rich reasoning.

Reflex Master handles fast, safety-critical responses via prioritized queues.

How It Works
Sensor Input: Each sensor independently captures real-time data.

Embedding: Each sensor's raw data is converted to a high-dimensional embedding using a dedicated model.

Graph Storage: All embeddings are asynchronously stored as nodes in the GraphDB, with relationships representing context, causality, or co-occurrence.

Similarity Search:

All graph nodes are queried using cosine similarity to retrieve relevant past experiences or patterns.

Dual Master Nodes:

Deliberative Master: Aggregates and reasons over the similarity results, issuing nuanced feedback or plans.

Reflex Master: Reacts rapidly to the first-available, high-priority pattern matches to trigger immediate body actions.

Use Cases
Real-time humanoid robot control in dynamic environments

Safety-critical systems requiring immediate reflexes (e.g., collision avoidance)

Context-aware assistive robotics

Adaptive smart home or industrial automation agents

Advanced simulation of cognitive architectures
